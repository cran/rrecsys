## Non-personalized RS in rrecsys

The included baseline predictors are the global mean rating (Global Average), itemâ€™s mean rating (Item Average), user's mean ratings (User Average) as well as an unpersonalized Most Popular method that determines item popularity based on the total number of (positive) ratings.

Training a model with them:
```{r}
# The maximum value of the dataset might not be required since the default value coincides to the actual maximal value of the dataset.
globAv <- rrecsys(smallML, alg = "globalaverage")
globAv
# Algorithm names might be matched on the registry partially.
itemAv <- rrecsys(smallML, "itemAver")
itemAv
userAv <- rrecsys(smallML, "useraverage")
userAv
```
Baseline recommenders do not require any argument.

The returned objec are of type _algAverageClass_.
